# LXD Containers Network Environment

LXD is the new LXC experience. It offers a completely fresh and intuitive user experience with a single command line tool to manage your containers. Containers can be managed over the network in a transparent way through a REST API. It also works with large scale deployments by integrating with cloud platforms like OpenNebula and OpenStack.
